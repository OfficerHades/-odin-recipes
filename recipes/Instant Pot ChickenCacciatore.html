                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil  </li>
                <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
                <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                
        </ul>

        <h5>Steps</h5>

        <ol>
            <li>Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry with paper towels.
                 Heat oil in the pot of an electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) on "Saute" mode; add chicken.
                  Cook until browned, about 6 minutes per side. 
                  Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving drippings in the pot.</li>
            <li>Place celery, onion, and mushrooms in the pot; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes.
                 Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
                 Place chicken back in the pot; add tomatoes and tomato paste.
                 Sprinkle with herbes de Provence. 
                 Top with water and bouillon</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid.
                 Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions.
                 Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
                  Cook for 11 minutes.</li>
            <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes.
                 Unlock and remove lid carefully, turning it away from you. 
                 Test chicken for doneness; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
                Season the chicken to taste with red pepper flakes and black pepper.</li>
           
        </ol>
